# ScavengARescape
### An augmented reality escape room where the items in your environment help you escape.
*This document describes our team social contract for this project*

## Roles
Switch Roles, on average, every 2 days
* **Task Lead** - Responsible for keeping track of the agenda, leading stand-ups, maintaining a high level overview of the project that day
* **Git Lead** - Responsible for creating and organizing issue tickets. Reviewing pull requests. Solving general git issues.

* **Break Lead** - Responsible for making sure the team takes regular breaks and bringing up team moral.

* **Test Lead** - TBD

## Daily process
* Morning standup started by yesterday's Task Lead
  * New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Task Lead)
  * Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (discussed by today’s Task Lead)
* Pair program to fix bugs
* Record issues, as they come up, that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels

## Team expectations
* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
* We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
* None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
* Don’t interrupt - raise your hand (remotely)
Share the mic
* Disagree often and discuss. Argue infrequently
* Message the group when you change what you are working on

## Issues
* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  * Take 10-15 minute break
  * List out the pros / cons
  * Vote on it
  * If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
* If you are frustrated
  * Take a walk or get some water
  * Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
* Acknowledging a person’s opinion point
  * Writing down member's points/ white boarding
